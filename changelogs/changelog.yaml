      breaking_changes:
      - The C(sudo) and C(sudo_nopasswd) options are deprecated.
      bugfixes:
      - user module sudo variables didn't work with recent versions of TrueNAS SCALE.
      deprecated_features:
      - In the user module, C(sudo) and C(sudo_nopasswd) options are deprecated. The
        C(sudo_commands) and C(sudo_commands_nopasswd) options are the preferred way

        for ZFS volumes.
      release_summary: add ZFS snapshot tasks
    release_date: '2023-06-23'
  1.5.1:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Fix formatting in docstrings, so docs should generate better now.
      release_summary: fix docstrings
    release_date: '2023-06-23'
  1.5.2:
    release_date: '2023-07-01'
  1.6.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - For now, the old behavior is still the default. To use the new behavior, set
        the "middleware_method" environment variable to "client", at either the play,
        block, or task level, using the "environment:" Ansible directive.
      - The default behavior will be switched from "midclt" to "client" in a later
        version.
      - Up until now, these modules have been invoking the 'midclt' utility on the
        TrueNAS client to communicate with the middleware daemon. But that is implemented
        using a Python module. This release makes it possible to use that Python module
        directly, resulting in a significant speed improvement (as well as simpler
        code).
      release_summary: Use native client code on the TrueNAS machine.
