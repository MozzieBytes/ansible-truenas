# Notes on hacking this collection

## Documentation

`antsibull-docs` is used to create and populate the `docs` directory:

    antsibull-docs sphinx-init --use-current --dest-dir new-docs arensb.truenas

This creates the `docs/build.sh` script, which is used to generate
documentation: it uses `antsibull-docs collection` to convert Python
module files into RST files in `docs/`, and then `sphinx-build` to
convert those RST files into HTML.

The files generated by `sphinx-build` go in `docs/build/`. That
directory can safely be deleted. In fact, if you make major changes
(including deleting modules), it's probably a good idea to delete
`docs/build/` and rebuild the documentation.
